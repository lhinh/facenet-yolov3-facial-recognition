# Facial Recognition with YoloV3 and FaceNet

The purpose of this project is to use pre-trained models of YoloV3 and FaceNet to identify celebrity faces. This involves a bit of data wrangling to only select a subset of images (selected_ids.txt) to be used for facial recognition.

## Project setup

Please download the files from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19chVP0F1Yqxdu9jscI12ocFXNQWzTudF?usp=sharing) and save in the following directories:

- ./Data/identity_CelebA.txt
- ./Data/selected_id.txt
- ./yolo_face/YOLO_Face.h5
- ./yolo_face/yolo_anchors.txt
- ./yolo_face/face_classes.txt
- ./facenet/facenet_keras.h5

Also please download the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7EVK8r0v71peklHb0pGdDl6R28) and extract in this directory:

- ./Data/img_celeba

Next, create the following directory:

- ./Data/subset/

Finally, run process-data.py to create a subset of images from selected_id.txt

## Requirements

- Python       == 3.6.8 64-bit <- This is important!
- scikit-learn == 0.24.1
- pillow       == 8.2.0

### The following will not install properly if Python is not 64-bit

- tensorflow == 2.4.1
- Keras      == 2.4.3
